# Bilde-Behandling
Some code for stereoscopic imaging , masks, object detection, range detection and calibration.
This file contains folders with different purposes, and together they will form
the possibilty to detect objects and its range from the camereas.
They all shall in the future work through a GUI, so the user can do different tasks without starting different sets of codes.
As of now the one thing missing out is calibration part.
